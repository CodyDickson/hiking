# hiking
This is a photo gallery website that is designed to showcase pictures taken during various hiking trips.

It was designed using HTML and CSS.

It uses JavaScript to navigate through the picture galleries via the use of a Left and Right arrow.

It uses CSS modals to allow users to enlarge pictures (and put the focus on the zoomed in picture). This works on mobile as well.

This GitHub only features 3 "pictures" for each gallery in the images folder because I did not want to upload a bunch of unnecessary pictures. To view the website in action with the full image galleries, please go here: http://www.codydickson.com/hiking/

The next step for this project is to tweak the design and make it a more cohesive experience between desktop and mobile view.
